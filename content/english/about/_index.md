My real name is Sebastian — and I run a small, independent balloon printing service focused on one thing above all else: quality over quantity 🎈

I started this project because I wanted to do printing *my way*. Many printing companies only accept large orders, fixed formats, or standard balloon sizes. If you only need a small batch — or even a very specific balloon printed just the way *you* imagine it — you’re often out of luck.
That’s where I come in.

## Small batches. Big balloons. Real customization.

I specialize in **custom balloon printing**, including **large balloon sizes** and **individual designs** that aren’t “one-size-fits-all”. Whether you need a batch of just **100 balloons**, a unique design for a private event, or something experimental that most companies would say no to — I’ll usually say *“let’s see how we can make it work.”*

I work solo, which means:

Direct communication
No unnecessary back-and-forth
And full control over quality

If I take on a job, I make sure it’s done properly.

## Built by an engineer, not a factory line

By day, I work as an **engineer**, and that technical background strongly influences how I approach balloon printing. I genuinely enjoy **building, modifying, and optimizing machines**, dialing in processes, and making sure prints are consistent, durable, and clean.

This isn’t mass production — it’s a carefully set up process where details matter:

Proper alignment
Clean ink transfer
Reliable results, even on larger balloons

If something can be improved, I’ll improve it.

## A side business with high standards

Balloon printing is a **side business** for me, but I treat it with the same seriousness and care as a full-time operation. I intentionally keep things manageable so I can focus on:

Custom requests
Honest advice
And results I’m confident putting my name on

My goal is simple:
You should feel **confident that you chose the right person** for your balloons.

## Let’s make something fun

If you’re a private customer, event planner, or just someone with a specific idea in mind — feel free to reach out. I’m always happy to talk through ideas, sizes, designs, and what’s realistically possible.

Playful ideas welcome.
Quality guaranteed. 🎉
