## Commission Information

BLOONYX offers custom balloon print commissions based on a carefully selected range of balloon types and materials.

### Available balloon types

A catalogue of balloon types that can currently be printed is available at the **[catalogue](/catalogue/types)**

This catalogue represents the **current printable inventory**.
Additional balloon types may be possible **upon request**, depending on material, size, and availability.

Please note:

* **Giant balloons larger than 36 inches are excluded from print commissions**, as they cannot be processed with the machine currently in use.
* Some balloon types may **not be in stock at all times** and may need to be reordered.
* In case of limited availability or delays, this will always be **clearly communicated** during the commission process.

### Print designs

You are welcome to commission BLOONYX with **your own print design**.

If you do not have a custom design, you can also choose from **ready-made balloon prints**, available at the **[catalogue](/catalogue/prints)**

These designs are pre-made and can be ordered without providing your own artwork.

### Ordering & commissions

Commission requests and orders will be available **starting at the end of 2026**.

Orders can be placed via:

* the **contact form**: **/contact**
* direct communication (e.g. direct messages)

The catalogue itself is intended as an **overview of available materials and designs**.
